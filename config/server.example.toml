# Alert Rules
#
# Rules are now managed via REST API or the `init-rules` CLI:
#
#   oxmon-server init-rules config/server.toml config/rules.seed.json
#
# See config/rules.seed.example.json for a seed file template.
# On first startup, any TOML [[alert.rules]] below will be auto-migrated to the database.
#
# REST API endpoints:
#   POST   /v1/alerts/rules              Create a rule
#   GET    /v1/alerts/rules              List rules
#   GET    /v1/alerts/rules/{id}         Get rule details

#   DELETE /v1/alerts/rules/{id}         Delete a rule
#   PUT    /v1/alerts/rules/{id}/enable  Enable/disable a rule
#
# Supported types: "threshold", "rate_of_change", "trend_prediction", "cert_expiration"

# Notification
#
# Channels and silence windows are managed via REST API or the `init-channels` CLI:
#
#   oxmon-server init-channels config/server.toml config/channels.seed.json

#
# REST API endpoints:
#   POST   /v1/notifications/channels/config       Create a channel
#   GET    /v1/notifications/channels               List channels (with recipients)
